### Step 1: **Create a Kubernetes Secret**
First, we'll create a secret to store sensitive information using Kubernetes native secrets.

Replace `<secret-name>` with your desired name for the secret, and `<key>=<value>` with the actual key-value pair you want to store.

```sh
kubectl create secret generic mysecret --from-literal=username=myuser --from-literal=password=mypassword
```

Here, a secret named "mysecret" is created with two key-value pairs.

### Step 2: **Deploy a Pod that Uses the Secret**
Create a `pod-using-secret.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-user-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: secret-user-container
      image: nginx:1.14.2
      volumeMounts:
      - name: secret-volume
        mountPath: "/etc/secret"
        readOnly: true
  volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretName: mysecret
```

This configuration creates a pod that mounts the "mysecret" secret as a volume at `/etc/secret`.

Apply the configuration:

```sh
kubectl apply -f pod-using-secret.yaml
```

### Step 3: **Setup External Secret Engine - HashiCorp Vault**
There's no direct `kubectl` command for this step, but we can deploy Vault on Kubernetes using the Helm package manager. First, install Helm if you haven't already, and then proceed.

Add the HashiCorp Helm repository:

```sh
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
```

Install Vault with Helm:

```sh
helm install vault hashicorp/vault --set "server.dev.enabled=true"
```

This installs Vault in dev mode, which is insecure but fine for learning and experimenting.

### Step 4: **Store a Secret in Vault**
You can interact with Vault via its CLI or API. Here weâ€™ll use the CLI. First, exec into the Vault pod:

```sh
kubectl exec -it vault-0 -- /bin/sh
```

Then run Vault commands to write a secret:

```sh
vault kv put secret/hello username="vaultuser" password="vaultpassword"
```

Exit the Vault shell:

```sh
exit
```

### Step 5: **Access Vault Secret from a Pod**
In a real-world scenario, you would have applications configured to pull secrets from Vault, or use something like the Vault Agent to inject secrets into your applications. Since this setup is complex and beyond a simple `kubectl` command, I recommend referring to the [official Vault documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs) for detailed steps.
