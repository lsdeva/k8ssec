### Step 1: **Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster**

For simplicity, we will use `kubeadm` to set up a Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 2: **Configure API Server for OIDC Authentication**

Here we are assuming you are using a service like Keycloak, Dex, or even Google as your OIDC provider.

You will need to modify the API server manifest file located typically in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node. You will have to add OIDC flags to the `spec.containers.command` section, such as:

```yaml
- --oidc-issuer-url=<issuer-url>
- --oidc-client-id=<client-id>
- --oidc-username-claim=email
- --oidc-groups-claim=groups
```

Replace `<issuer-url>` with your OIDC provider URL and `<client-id>` with the client ID for your Kubernetes cluster in your OIDC provider.

The Kubernetes API server will need to be restarted after modifying its manifest.

### Step 3: **Implement RBAC for Authorization**

1. **Create a Role or ClusterRole**

Here is a sample role definition in a file named `role.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

Create the role:

```bash
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
```

2. **Create RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding**

Hereâ€™s a sample RoleBinding definition in a file named `rolebinding.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: "janedoe"
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Replace `"janedoe"` with the name of the user you want to bind the role to. Create the RoleBinding:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
```

### Step 4: **Verification**

- For **authentication**, you can verify it by trying to access the Kubernetes API. You should be challenged to authenticate using your OIDC provider.

- For **authorization**, you can use `kubectl auth can-i` to check if the permissions are applied correctly. For example:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i get pods --as=janedoe
```

Replace `"janedoe"` with the actual username that was used in the RoleBinding.
