Create a sample application, scan its Docker image for vulnerabilities, sign it, and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 1: **Set Up Image Scanning with Clair**

#### 1. **Run Clair Scanner**
You can run Clair as a Docker container and use Clair scanner to scan your images. Start by pulling the Clair image and running it:

```bash
docker pull arminc/clair-local-scan:v2.0.1
docker run -d -p 6060:6060 --name clair arminc/clair-local-scan:v2.0.1
```

#### 2. **Scan Your Docker Image**
Before scanning, ensure you have built a Docker image for your application. Then, use clair-scanner to scan your image:

```bash
docker pull arminc/clair-scanner:v12
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $PWD/clair-reports:/report arminc/clair-scanner <your-image>
```

Replace `<your-image>` with the name of the Docker image you want to scan.

### Step 2: **Use Docker Content Trust to Sign Images**

#### 1. **Enable Docker Content Trust**
Enable DCT to ensure all operations with a remote registry are signed:

```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

#### 2. **Push the Signed Image**
When Docker Content Trust is enabled, images pushed to a registry are signed by default. Push your image:

```bash
docker push <your-image>
```

### Step 3: **Deploy to Kubernetes**

#### 1. **Create a Namespace**
Let’s isolate our deployment by creating a new namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace image-security
```

#### 2. **Deploy the Application**
Create a deployment manifest, ensuring that it refers to the signed image you pushed:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: secure-app
  namespace: image-security
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: secure-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: secure-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: <your-image>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply the deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Step 4: **Verification**
Verify the deployment, checking if the pod is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n image-security
```

### Conclusion

In this project, you have:

1. Scanned a Docker image for vulnerabilities using Clair.
2. Signed the Docker image using Docker Content Trust.
3. Deployed the signed image to a Kubernetes cluster.

Always ensure that you’re using secure, scanned, and signed images to have confidence in the security and integrity of your deployed applications. Adapt and expand upon this example according to the specific needs and complexity of your projects.
