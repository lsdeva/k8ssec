### Step 1: **Setup and Pre-requisites**
Ensure that you have `kubectl` configured and Helm installed to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 2: **Run kube-bench for CIS Benchmarks Validation**

#### 1. **Clone kube-bench GitHub Repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench.git
cd kube-bench
```

#### 2. **Run kube-bench:**

You can run kube-bench as a Job in your cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
```

#### 3. **Check kube-bench Results:**

After the job completes, view the results with the following command:

```sh
kubectl logs -l job-name=kube-bench
```

#### 4. **Address Security Issues:**
Analyze the results and work on remediation based on the recommendations provided by kube-bench.

### Step 3: **Install Aqua Security for Runtime Security**

#### 1. **Add Aqua Helm Repository:**

```sh
helm repo add aqua-helm https://helm.aquasec.com
```

#### 2. **Update Helm Repositories:**

```sh
helm repo update
```

#### 3. **Install Aqua Security:**

You might want to configure the values.yaml file as per your requirements. For instance, set up the necessary credentials, resources, and configurations. Then run:

```sh
helm install aqua-security aqua-helm/aqua --version 6.2 --namespace aqua
```

**Note**: Replace `'6.2'` with the actual version number of the Aqua Security Helm chart you intend to use.

#### 4. **Verify Aqua Security Installation:**

```sh
kubectl get pods -n aqua
```

Ensure all Aqua Security components are running as expected.

### Step 4: **Configure Aqua Security**

1. **Access Aqua Console:**

You may need to expose the Aqua Security console service to access it. Create an appropriate service or ingress, or use port forwarding. Then, log in using the credentials provided/configured during the installation.

2. **Configure Policies:**

Define and configure security policies as per your organization's requirements within the Aqua console.

3. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline (optional):**

Integrate Aqua Security with your CI/CD pipeline for scanning container images during the build and deployment process.

### Step 5: **Validation**

1. **kube-bench:**

   - **Review**: Go through the kube-bench results and review the recommendations.
   - **Remediate**: Apply the necessary changes to meet the recommended security settings.

2. **Aqua Security:**

   - **Monitoring**: Monitor the Aqua Security dashboard for any security alerts and runtime security incidents.
   - **Testing**: Deploy various workloads to test if the Aqua Security policies are enforced appropriately.
