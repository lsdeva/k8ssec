Create a project that integrates Falco for runtime security and anomaly detection in a Kubernetes environment. Also, we’ll add a security plugin to enhance the security measures.

### Step 1: **Preparation**

Ensure that you have `kubectl`, `helm`, and a Kubernetes cluster ready.

### Step 2: **Install Falco**

We'll install Falco using Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes.

#### 1. **Add the Falco Helm Chart Repository:**

```sh
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
```

#### 2. **Update Helm Repositories:**

```sh
helm repo update
```

#### 3. **Install Falco:**

```sh
helm install falco falcosecurity/falco
```

Falco is now installed and will monitor the runtime behavior of your cluster.

### Step 3: **Install a Security Plugin**

For this project, let’s consider installing kube-bench, a tool that checks whether Kubernetes is deployed securely by running the checks documented in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.

#### 1. **Clone kube-bench GitHub Repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench.git
cd kube-bench
```

#### 2. **Run kube-bench:**

For example, to run kube-bench as a Job in your cluster, apply the job YAML:

```sh
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
```

Now, kube-bench will run as a Job in your cluster and report on your cluster’s security configuration.

### Step 4: **Verify Installation**

#### 1. **Check Falco Installation:**

Check if Falco pods are running:

```sh
kubectl get pods -l app=falco
```

#### 2. **Check kube-bench Results:**

Get the results of the kube-bench job:

```sh
kubectl logs -l job-name=kube-bench
```

### Step 5: **Analyze Results and Enhance Security**

Based on the findings from Falco and kube-bench, take the necessary actions to enhance your cluster's security.

- **For Falco:**
  Review Falco logs and alerts, and create custom rules if necessary to suit your environment and security requirements.

- **For kube-bench:**
  Address the suggestions and findings of kube-bench to enhance the security configurations of your Kubernetes cluster.
