### Step 1: **Plan the Upgrade**
First, it's essential to plan the upgrade. Check which versions are available to upgrade to:

```sh
apt update
apt-cache madison kubeadm
```

or

```sh
yum list --showduplicates kubeadm --disableexcludes=kubernetes
```

Choose an appropriate version that you wish to upgrade to.

### Step 2: **Upgrade Control Plane Node**

#### 1. **Drain the Control Plane Node**
Make the control plane node unschedulable and evict the workloads:

```sh
kubectl drain <control-plane-node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
```

Replace `<control-plane-node-name>` with the name of your control plane node.

#### 2. **Upgrade kubeadm**
Upgrade `kubeadm` on the control plane node:

```sh
apt install -y kubeadm=<version>
```

or 

```sh
yum install -y kubeadm-<version> --disableexcludes=kubernetes
```

Replace `<version>` with the chosen version.

#### 3. **Plan the Upgrade**
Before applying the upgrade, check the upgrade plan to get an overview of the actions to be taken:

```sh
kubeadm upgrade plan
```

#### 4. **Apply the Upgrade**
Upgrade the control plane node:

```sh
kubeadm upgrade apply <version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the desired version.

### Step 3: **Upgrade the Kubelet and kubectl**

#### 1. **Upgrade kubelet and kubectl Packages**
On the control plane node, upgrade `kubelet` and `kubectl`:

```sh
apt install -y kubelet=<version> kubectl=<version>
```

or 

```sh
yum install -y kubelet-<version> kubectl-<version> --disableexcludes=kubernetes
```

Replace `<version>` with the chosen version.

#### 2. **Restart the Kubelet**
Restart the kubelet to apply the changes:

```sh
systemctl restart kubelet
```

### Step 4: **Upgrade Worker Nodes**

#### 1. **Drain the Worker Node**
Drain each worker node. Replace `<node-name>` with the name of your worker node:

```sh
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
```

#### 2. **Upgrade kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl**
Repeat the upgrade steps for `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl` on each worker node, as performed on the control plane node.

#### 3. **Join the Node Back to the Cluster**
Although not always necessary, you can rejoin the node to the cluster if needed:

```sh
kubeadm join <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <hash>
```

Replace placeholders with actual values.

#### 4. **Uncordon the Node**
Make the worker node schedulable again:

```sh
kubectl uncordon <node-name>
```

Repeat these steps for each worker node in your cluster.

### Step 5: **Verification**
Verify that all nodes are ready and the Kubernetes version has been updated:

```sh
kubectl get nodes
```
